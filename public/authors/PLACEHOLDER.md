# Author Avatar Placeholders

The system is currently configured to show author initials when no avatar image is provided.

## To Add Real Author Avatars:

1. Add author photos to this folder with these filenames:
   - `sarah-mitchell.jpg`
   - `james-patterson.jpg`
   - `emma-thompson.jpg`

2. The avatars will automatically appear once the files are added (no code changes needed!)

3. Recommended specs:
   - Size: 400x400px (square)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File size: Under 200KB

## Current Behavior:

Without avatar images, the components display:
- **Article cards**: Grey circle with author initials (e.g., "SM" for Sarah Mitchell)
- **Article pages**: White circle with dark initials on the colored hero background

This provides a clean, professional fallback until real photos are added.
